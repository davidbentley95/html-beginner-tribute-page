            <p>Alexander the Great (356-323 BC) was the king of Macedonia who conquered an empire that stretched from the Balkans to modern-day Pakistan. The son of King Philip II of Macedon and Queen Olympias, Alexander was educated by the philosopher Aristotle. He ascended to the throne in 336 BC and spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa. By the age of thirty, he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to Egypt and into the northwest Indian subcontinent.</p>
            <p>Alexander is celebrated as one of history's most successful military commanders. His tactics and strategies are still studied in military academies around the world. Despite his early death at the age of 32 in Babylon under mysterious circumstances, Alexander's legacy as a powerful ruler and a brilliant strategist endures. His empire fragmented shortly after his death, but his conquests spread Greek culture throughout the known world, marking the beginning of the Hellenistic period which featured a blend of Greek, Middle Eastern, and Asian cultures.</p>
